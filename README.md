# This app is currently deployed on:
https://tech-test-jason.onrender.com/

# On github at:

# How to Run Application Locally

- I used pnpm to experiement. npm / yarn should also work

- pnpm/npm/yarn install
- pnpm/npm/yarn run dev 

# How to Run Cypress Tests

- install using the above commands first.
- pnpm run cypress:open
- run through the specs.

# If this was a larger/proper application I would:

- Restrict google api key to the desired URL.
- Choose a different folder structure.
- Add more tests.
